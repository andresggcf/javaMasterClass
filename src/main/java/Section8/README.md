# Section 8: Arrays, Java inbuilt Lists, Autoboxing and Unboxing

###Arrays
An array is a group of like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name.
Array can contain primitives (int, char, etc.) as well as object (or non-primitive) 
references of a class depending on the definition of the array. In case of primitive 
data types, the actual values are stored in contiguous memory locations. In case of 
objects of a class, the actual objects are stored in heap segment.
